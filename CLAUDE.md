# CLAUDE.md

Go immediately to `AIOS/me.md` and read it. Then read `AIOS/vault-map.md` and
`AIOS/skill-map.md`.

Do this every time without exception at the start of every session.

Confirm in one line that you've read all three, then wait for instructions.

Never read or write anything under `Privat/`.

**If `AIOS/me.md` still contains `<< >>` placeholders, the vault has not been
set up yet.** Say so, and offer to set it up — the trigger is just **"set
yourself up"**, which runs the `setup-vault` skill end to end (scripts,
skills, the interview, and a self-check) without needing anything else typed
first. Working from an unfilled `me.md` means working with no rules at all.

**If you can't confirm the six skills in `AIOS/skills/` are active as real,
natively-triggering skills on this platform** (this is normal on Cowork —
see `AIOS/skills/README.md`), **read `AIOS/skills/auto-capture/SKILL.md`,
`AIOS/skills/vault-first/SKILL.md`, `AIOS/skills/vault-librarian/SKILL.md`
and `AIOS/skills/no-bullshit/SKILL.md` now, in full, and follow them for this
session anyway.** The vault is supposed to behave the same way whether or not
the platform's own skill system is doing the work — these files are the
actual behavior either way.

## Updating from the Vault Blueprint

When I say **"update my vault from the blueprint"** (or anything close —
"check for blueprint updates", "is there anything new in the blueprint"),
follow `AIOS/skills/update-vault/SKILL.md` in full. Short version:

1. `python3 AIOS/scripts/blueprint-update.py --json`
2. Read every waiting change out to me in plain English — what it does for me,
   not which file changed — numbered, and ask which ones I want.
3. Apply the ones I picked with `--apply`. Record the ones I turned down with
   `--decline`, so I'm never asked about them again.
4. `CLAUDE.md`, `AIOS/me.md`, `AIOS/vault-map.md` and `AIOS/skill-map.md` are
   half mine — never let the script write those. Merge the structural change
   into them by hand and keep every word I wrote.

Never apply anything without asking. Never touch `Privat/`. Never delete a
file because the blueprint stopped shipping it.

---

That's deliberately the entire file. All real content lives in `AIOS/`, which is
provider-agnostic. If you switch AI providers, you write a new one-line pointer
file (`gemini.md`, `agent.md`, whatever it wants) aimed at the same `AIOS/`
folder — and nothing else changes.

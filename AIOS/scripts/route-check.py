route-check.py — make every note findable in one grep, and shout when one isn't.

Why this exists
---------------
A project note can exist, be correct, and be complete, and still cost several
minutes and a wall of tool calls to find again — if `AIOS/vault-map.md`
doesn't contain the word someone would actually type. That's the second of
two failure modes this vault design cares about:

    "A right fact written down, then NOT inherited — the fix exists in a note
    nothing reads."

`AIOS/me.md` already carries the rule: *"update `vault-map.md` so the next
session can find it too."* A session that creates a note can just forget to.
A rule that fires only when someone remembers it is not a mechanism.

So: two mechanisms, one cheap, one loud.

1. `AIOS/generated/where.md` — GENERATED. One line per note: its path, its
   title, and the words that actually distinguish it from every other note.
   A session that doesn't know where something lives greps ONE file instead
   of ripgrepping the whole vault:

       grep -i gravel AIOS/generated/where.md

   Deliberately NOT in the boot set — it costs nothing until it's needed,
   the opposite of routing rows in `vault-map.md`, which load in every
   session forever, so only genuinely hot routes belong there.

2. `--check` — fails when a note in `Efforts/` has no route in `vault-map.md`.
   Projects are what you ask about by name mid-decision, so those earn a
   place in the boot file. Everything else rides on where.md.

How the trigger words are picked
--------------------------------
TF-IDF-lite, stdlib only. A word earns a place if it is frequent inside its
own note and rare across the vault. Filename words, `title:` and `aliases:`
are always included regardless of rarity, because those are what a person
types first.

This is an index, not a summary. It answers "which file", never "what does it
say" — the note is still the content.

Usage
-----
    python3 AIOS/scripts/route-check.py            # rebuild AIOS/generated/where.md
    python3 AIOS/scripts/route-check.py --check    # report only, changes nothing
    python3 AIOS/scripts/route-check.py --find gravel bike   # query the index
    python3 AIOS/scripts/route-check.py --exists "bike budgeting"  # before creating
    python3 AIOS/scripts/route-check.py --dupes    # one subject, two notes
    python3 AIOS/scripts/route-check.py --naming   # filenames breaking the scheme

Exit codes: 0 fine · 1 an Efforts/ note has no route (--check only) · 2 couldn't run.

No dependencies. Plain stdlib.

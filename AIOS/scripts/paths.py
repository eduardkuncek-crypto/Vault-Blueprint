"""
AIOS/scripts/paths.py

The single source of truth for every path in the vault that anything —
script, note, or human — might need to refer to.

If a folder or file listed here ever moves or gets renamed, this is the ONE
file that changes. Don't edit it by hand and then go fix every note and
script that mentioned the old path — run:

    python3 AIOS/scripts/move.py "<old/path>" "<new/path>" --reason "..."

move.py does the actual move, rewrites this file's constant, rewrites every
place across the vault (notes, scripts, config) that referenced the old
path, and logs the change to AIOS/reference/moves.md. See that file for
the history of every relocation made this way.

New scripts should import their paths from here instead of hardcoding a
string. Existing scripts still build their own paths locally — move.py
rewrites those in place when something moves, so nothing has to be
mass-migrated to adopt this file.

# pattern-matching the literal chain of quoted parts, and a constant built
# from another constant (SCRIPTS = AIOS / "scripts") hides part of that
# chain behind a name move.py can't see through. Flat chains are the only

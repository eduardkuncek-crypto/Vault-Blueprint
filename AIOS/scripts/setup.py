setup.py — make this computer into a working vault machine. Cross-platform:
Linux, macOS and Windows are all first-class here, not "Linux, and Windows if
you're lucky."

    python3 AIOS/scripts/setup.py            # set this machine up
    python3 AIOS/scripts/setup.py --check    # say what's missing, change nothing

What it does
------------
  1. Checks Python is new enough.
  2. Creates the folders the automation writes into.
  3. Finds a scheduler for this OS (cron on Linux/macOS, Task Scheduler on
     Windows) and, if one exists, installs three recurring jobs — none
     duplicated if already present:
       - the chat backup (backup-cowork.py), hourly
       - the changelog safety net (changelog-check.py), every 30 min
       - the git snapshot (vault-snapshot.py), every 10 min — only if git
         is installed; entirely optional, see that script's own docstring
  4. Runs the vault's own health check and prints the result.
  5. Prints exactly what still needs a human — installing an app, signing
     into an account. A script that half-installs something with sudo is
     worse than one that hands you the one command to run yourself.

Everything it does is safe to repeat. It never deletes and never overwrites a
note.

IMPORTANT — read this if you're running this from an AI chat session
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If the AI running this is working inside a cloud sandbox rather than on your
own computer, everything below still *runs* without error, but the cron job
/ scheduled task it installs lives inside a disposable container that gets
thrown away — so the backup will look "installed" and then simply never fire
again. There is no way for a script to detect this with certainty, which is
why `AIOS/scripts/setup-check.py` exists: run it again in a day or two and
check the jobs are still there. If they vanished, this needs to run in a
terminal on your actual computer instead (Claude Code, or Cowork's "on this
device" mode, not a cloud/hosted session).

No dependencies. Plain stdlib.

blueprint-update.py — pull improvements from the Vault Blueprint into YOUR vault,
without ever touching a single word you wrote.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
You downloaded the Vault Blueprint once and made it yours. Since then the
blueprint got better — a new script, a safer rule, a folder that turned out to
be worth having. This fetches whatever changed and offers it to you, one item
at a time, in plain English:

    [3] Screenshots now get saved into AIOS/history/screenshots/ instead of
        sitting in Inbox/. Adds the folder and an index note.
        Want it? (y/n)

Nothing is applied unless you say so. Your notes are never read, never
rewritten, never deleted. `Privat/` is untouchable and hard-coded as such.

HOW TO USE IT
-------------
    python3 AIOS/scripts/blueprint-update.py                 # show what's waiting
    python3 AIOS/scripts/blueprint-update.py --interactive   # ask y/n for each
    python3 AIOS/scripts/blueprint-update.py --apply 1,3,5   # apply just those
    python3 AIOS/scripts/blueprint-update.py --apply all     # apply everything
    python3 AIOS/scripts/blueprint-update.py --decline 2,4   # never ask again
    python3 AIOS/scripts/blueprint-update.py --undo          # put back the last update
    python3 AIOS/scripts/blueprint-update.py --check         # one line, for a schedule
    python3 AIOS/scripts/blueprint-update.py --json          # for your AI to read

Or just tell your AI: **"update my vault from the blueprint"**.

HOW IT DECIDES WHAT'S SAFE
--------------------------
Every file the blueprint ships is labelled in `AIOS/config/blueprint-manifest.json`:

  system     Scripts, skills, templates. Blueprint owns these. Safe to update.
  seed       Files you were given once to fill in yourself (me.md, the EXAMPLE
             notes, your index notes). Written on install, never overwritten.
  brain      CLAUDE.md, AIOS/me.md, vault-map.md, skill-map.md. A script must
             NEVER write these — they're half yours. Changes here are handed to
             your AI to merge by hand, keeping everything personal intact.
  structure  Folders. A new one is offered, never forced.
  never      Privat/, your history, your generated files. Not looked at.

For `system` files it does a three-way comparison, which is the bit that makes
this safe: it remembers the exact version it gave you last time. So it can tell
the difference between "you never touched this, take the new one" and "you
edited this yourself, I must ask first". A file you customised is flagged as a
conflict and shown as a diff — it is never silently overwritten.

Everything it does touch gets backed up first, into
`AIOS/history/blueprint-updates/<timestamp>/`, so `--undo` is real.

NO DEPENDENCIES. Plain Python 3.8+ stdlib. Works with or without git — if git
isn't installed it downloads a tarball straight from GitHub instead.

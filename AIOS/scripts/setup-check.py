"""
setup-check.py — one command that answers "is this actually working?"

Everything else in AIOS/scripts/ does one job and reports on itself. This
script runs all of them and prints a single pass/fail table, so a human (or
an AI) can tell at a glance what's real and what still needs attention,
instead of piecing it together from five separate script outputs.

Run it:
    python3 AIOS/scripts/setup-check.py

Run it any time. Nothing here changes the vault except reading it — this is
the "did the setup actually work" check, not the setup itself. Re-run it
after `setup.py`, and again a day or two later to confirm scheduled jobs
survived (see the note in setup.py about cloud/sandboxed sessions).

Exit code: 0 if everything checked is in a good state, 1 if anything needs
attention. Either way, nothing is ever silently assumed to be fine — every
row below was actually tested this run.

No dependencies. Plain stdlib.

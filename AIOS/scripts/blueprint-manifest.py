blueprint-manifest.py — label every file the blueprint ships, so the updater
knows what it's allowed to touch.

Run this in the BLUEPRINT folder (not in someone's real vault) whenever the
blueprint changes. It writes `AIOS/config/blueprint-manifest.json`, which
`blueprint-update.py` reads on the other end.

    python3 AIOS/scripts/blueprint-manifest.py            # write it
    python3 AIOS/scripts/blueprint-manifest.py --check    # is it out of date?

THE FIVE LABELS
---------------
The whole safety of the update system is this one decision per file. Getting a
file into the wrong class is the only way this thing can hurt somebody.

  system     The blueprint owns it outright. Scripts, skills, templates,
             reference docs. Nobody's personal writing is in here, so it can be
             updated in place — as long as they haven't edited it themselves,
             which the updater checks separately.

  seed       Handed over once, then it's theirs. `setup-questions.md`, the
             EXAMPLE notes, index notes like `Efforts/Efforts.md` that fill up
             with their own links. Shipped on install, NEVER overwritten after.

  brain      Half blueprint, half person: `CLAUDE.md`, `AIOS/me.md`,
             `vault-map.md`, `skill-map.md`, `how-to-use-this.md`. A script must
             never write these. Changes are handed to their AI, which merges the
             new structural bit and leaves every personal line alone.

  structure  A `.gitkeep` standing in for a folder. Offered as "want this
             folder too?", never forced.

  never      Not shipped, not compared, not looked at.

WHEN IN DOUBT, PICK THE MORE CAUTIOUS ONE. `seed` never overwrites anything;
`system` does. A file wrongly marked `seed` means someone misses an
improvement. A file wrongly marked `system` means someone loses their writing.
Those are not the same size of mistake.
